Hello!

This project is a basic recipe website. With this project, the aim is to practice all of the HTML knowledge that I have acquired up to this point.

This will be a demonstration of my ability to set up an HTML file with the proper boilerplate. With my newfound knowledge, I can add to the body with headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, relative and absolute links, and images.

I am very proud of how far I've come in so little time. I am also pleasantly suprised with the ease and fun I've had so far investing my time into learning. I cannot wait to see what else I'm able to do, further down the line.
