        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm Water</li>
            <li>Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Whole Wheat Flour</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix warm water, yeast, and 1/3 cup honey in a large bowl to dissolve. Add 5 cups bread flour, and stir to combine. Let sit for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup honey, and salt. Stir in 2 cups whole wheat flour. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and gradually knead in remaining 2 cups whole wheat flour. Knead until dough starts to pull away from the work surface, adding more whole wheat flour if necessary; dough should be a bit tacky to the touch, but not too sticky.</li>
            <li>Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough. Cover with a dish towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Grease three 9x5-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough, and divide it into 3 loaves. Place in the prepared loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, another 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 25 to 30 minutes, do not overbake.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush the tops of the loaves with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter when done to prevent crust from getting hard. Cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
